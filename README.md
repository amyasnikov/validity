# Validity: vendor agnostic configuration compliance
## What is it?
Validity is the NetBox plugin to deal with configuration compliance. You define compliance tests and Validity checks network device configuration files against these tests. As a result you can see which devices are provisioned properly (according to the tests you have written) and which are not.
